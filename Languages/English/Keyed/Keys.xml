  <MFI_FactionWarPeaceTalksIntroduction>The two opposing faction leaders {0} and {1} each made quarters in opposite corners of the make-shift camp. Tensions are high as your negotiator {2} walks in. The past few days have been taxing on all parties involved, and your negotiator knows that what they'll say can have far reaching consequences.\n\n{2} has the following options:</MFI_FactionWarPeaceTalksIntroduction>

  <!-- Faction war, favour one faction over the other -->
  <MFI_FactionWarFavourFactionDisaster>The talks were a disaster. Neither faction appreciated your negotiator's attempt to butter up {0}.

  <MFI_FactionWarFavourFactionTriumph>The talks were a great triumph! Your negotiator played a large role in convincing {1} to pay reparations for past aggressions, much to the delight of {0}.\n\nRelations with {0} increased massively.\n\nRelations with {1} deteriorated.</MFI_FactionWarFavourFactionTriumph>
  <!-- Faction war, sabotage to benefit colony -->
  <MFI_FactionWarSabotageDisaster>The sabotage was a massive failure. The delegates quickly uncovered your negotiator's intent and both factions turned against you! Your caravan made a hurried departure, but warriors from both factions caught up with it and attacked!\n\nRelations with {0} have broken down. They are now hostile towards you.\n\nRelations with {1} have broken down. They are now hostile towards you.</MFI_FactionWarSabotageDisaster>
  <MFI_FactionWarSabotageBackFire>The sabotage has backfired.

  <MFI_FactionWarSabotageTriumph>The sabotage was a great triumph of sorts!

  <!-- Faction war, broker peace -->
  <MFI_FactionWarBrokerPeaceDisaster>The talks were a disaster. The delegates barely got past their initial greetings before the discussion broke down into insults and recriminations.

  <MFI_FactionWarBrokerPeaceBackFire>The talks have backfired. Despite exchanging some pleasantries, the delegates made no progress on substantive issues, and multiple statements were interpreted as insults. They've decided to resume and reschedule the peace talks for a later date.\n\nRelations with {0} remain unchanged.\n\nRelations with {1} remain unchanged.</MFI_FactionWarBrokerPeaceBackFire>

  <MFI_AnnualExpoDialogueIntroduction>Your caravan has arrived at the annual exposition. As this year's theme is {0}, there are many experts on that topic here. Most of them are preparing, while others have already started showing off their skills.\n\nThe expo is a hodge-podge of stalls, some modest and made of locally sourced materials while others are high-tech pre-fabs from Urb worlds.
