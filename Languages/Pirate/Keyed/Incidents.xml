  <MFI_MysticalShamanFoundNoSickPawn>The Shaman emerges from his polyester teepee just before your caravan announces their presence. He judges your group silently, passing one quivering eye over your decidedly healthy group, the other eye crossed in apparent meditation. Visibly sweating, he orders you to wait a respectable distance while he retreats back in his teepee. Moments later you hear the rustling of fabric and the sound of a muffalo being spurred on.\n\nIt seems the mystical shaman packed up and left.</MFI_MysticalShamanFoundNoSickPawn>
  <MFI_MysticalShamanDoesHisMagic>The Shaman seems to have been expecting you, and with great practice regales you the tale of his "healer's hands". Once finished, he invites {0} into his teepee.

  <MFI_WoundedCombatantGratitude>The commander gives you an earnest and heartfelt salute. It loses a lot of its impact and meaning as you can't see the gesture through the radio, so you hang up.</MFI_WoundedCombatantGratitude>
  <MFI_WoundedCombatantAmbushAvoided>You hear a voice in the background yell, asking if "they've taken the bait yet". You quickly hang up, confused and somewhat relieved you escaped potential disaster.</MFI_WoundedCombatantAmbushAvoided>
