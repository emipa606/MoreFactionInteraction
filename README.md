Update of Mehnis mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1454024362

- Updated by Taranchuk
- Commissioned by Spark7979
- Updated as is, have not been tested with other mods than those listed below. Please report if any mod is not compatible.
- Added german translation, thanks Erdnussbrot!
- Added Czech translation, thanks FubarXS!
- Increased the time modifier for faction interaction max-value to 10
- Added option to disable Annual Expo since it seems to cause issues for some users

- Reported to work with Dynamic Diplomacy and the 'Vanilla Expanded' factions series. Thank you Black Goat.
- Seems to work best loaded at the bottom of the mod-list

Regarding getting too many caravans: (via Black Goat)
” MFI increases probability of trade caravans arriving based on faction goodwill. This is working as intended but I suspect this feature can be compounded to an unwanted degree for players using a lot of faction mods and/or by using Dynamic Diplomacy with certain settings.

My recommendations for people who play with MFI + DD or faction mods would be to increase the "Time modifier for faction interaction" slider in the MFI mod settings menu from 1 to 3 and to disable the "Allow Alliance" and "Allow permanent enemy factions to change relationships" options for DD. ”

- Another solution for the trader-spam is to use my mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2813027453]Ask before enter

Adds more interaction with and between factions, bringing the world to life.

# Meaningful faction relations

- Build up trust and factions will reward you
- Cement relations by inter-faction marriages
- Help factions recover from various setbacks
- Factions may call upon you for labour
- Favours for favours
- Increased rate of world events

# Trade improvements

- Specialised traders desperate for certain goods
- More frequent traders, if you treat them right
- Traders get richer as you build up trust
- Traders bring higher quality as relations increase

# A living world

- Pirates spread out and grow outposts
- Pirates can demand tribute if they're close by - destroy their outposts!
- Show off your skills at the yearly exposition. Maybe you'll do well and be invited to host next year?
- Roadworks. To strengthen ties and increase trade, your allies can build roads as a nice silver sink.
- Squatters! Someone found a use for an old deserted settlement.

# Warring factions

- Unrest is brewing between two factions! Will you pick a side, stay neutral or profiteer? 

# TL;DR: More events

- Diplomatic marriages
- Reverse trade requests
- Bumper crops
- Hunter's Lodge
- Pirate extortion
- Mystical Shaman
- Annual Expo
- Squatters
- Roadworks
- Faction WAR
